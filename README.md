# Sign-Language-Detection-Through-Computer-Vision

This project is built upon the original repository: https://github.com/Kazuhito00/hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe. 

In the original repository, the code is designed for recognizing one hand at a time, whereas the modified code here is capable of detecting both left and right hands in a single frame.

The model can be trained to recognize 10 sign language gestures, each indexed from 0 to 9.
